LitePaper: Soulbound NFT Collection for Decentralized Governance Off-Chain Discord /
On-Chain Stargaze
Version 1.0 | June 2025
Abstract
In the evolving Web3 ecosystem, trust and transparency remain critical challenges. Our
Soulbound NFT collection on the Stargaze network is designed to build a robust
decentralized governance system where credibility and governance weight stem directly
from genuine contributions. By employing non-transferable (soulbound) tokens, we ensure
that each member’s identity is uniquely bound to their contributions, eliminating risks related
to token trading and external manipulation. This paper details the rationale, features, and
benefits of our Soulbound NFT collection.
1. Introduction
The Web3 landscape promises true decentralization, yet issues such as rug pulls,
concentrated voting power, and misinformation continue to undermine trust. Traditional
tokens are often transferable, which can dilute the direct connection between a member’s
contributions and their influence in governance. Our protocol uses non-transferable,
Soulbound NFTs to ensure that every governance-related asset is permanently linked to the
original member, thereby reinforcing both credibility and accountability.
2. Rationale for Non-Transferable (Soulbound) NFTs
•
Immutable Identity:
Soulbound NFTs are permanently bound to a single wallet, ensuring that each member’s
identity and governance weight are immutable. This guarantees that voting power and
credibility arise solely from verified contributions.
•
Eliminating External Manipulation:
By preventing the transfer or sale of these tokens, the protocol avoids external manipulation
and preserves a meritocratic, community-driven decision-making process.
•
Enhanced Credibility:
Only individuals who have completed our educational module and received their Truth ID
NFT can vote, propose and invite new members, ensuring that the community grows
organically and with aligned values.
3. Features of the Soulbound NFT Collection
3.1 Truth ID NFT
•
Purpose:
Serves as a unique digital identity for each member.
•
Function:
Minted upon passing a gamified educational program on protocol rules, it certifies that the
member understands and commits to the protocol’s principles.
•
Governance Role:
Grants access to decentralized governance and the right to invite new members.
3.2 Creator NFT
•
Purpose:
Awarded to members with significant contributions.
•
Function:
This NFT, minted only once per member, initially holds 51% of the total voting power. It can
later be burned to facilitate a co-creation process, redistributing the 51% power into two or
more NFTs based on negotiated divisions.
•
Governance Role:
Ensures that creative contributions are highly valued and that governance power is
reallocated based on merit.
3.3 Collaborator NFT
•
Purpose:
Minted daily to acknowledge individual contributions.
•
Function:
Each Collaborator NFT is unique and carries a voting weight between 1 and 7, based on the
quality and impact of the contribution.
•
Governance Role:
Directly influences the credibility ranking and overall governance weight of a member.
3.4 Red Pill NFT
•
Purpose:
Acts as a weekly voting multiplier, reinforcing active participation and alignment with
community consensus.
•
Function:
Minted every Sunday, it calculates a multiplier using the formula:
\text{Multiplier} = (\% \text{Participation} \times \% \text{Alignment} \times 7)
Each wallet is limited to a maximum of 3 Red Pill NFTs; the oldest is burned every 28 days.
•
Governance Role:
Enhances the voting power of members who consistently participate and align with the
community’s values.
4. Integration with Decentralized Governance
Our Soulbound NFT collection is a cornerstone for a governance system where:
•
Credibility is Earned:
Governance weight is directly linked to verified contributions and ethical behavior.
•
Controlled Recruitment:
Only members holding a Truth ID NFT can invite new participants, ensuring quality and
alignment.
•
Transparency is Maintained:
Initially operating off-chain (via Discord), the system is designed for gradual integration with
on-chain governance as the community grows.
•
Ethical Participation is Rewarded:
The protocol continuously rewards truth and alignment—contributing to a sustainable,
merit-based governance ecosystem.
5. Conclusion
Our Soulbound NFT collection on Stargaze is designed to serve as the bedrock of a
decentralized governance system that values genuine contributions and ethical behavior. By
utilizing non-transferable tokens, we ensure that every member’s identity is intrinsically
linked to their impact, fostering a transparent and accountable community. This approach not
only secures governance integrity but also paves the way for future enhancements, including
the introduction of the $D.Truth Token for staking and additional incentives
