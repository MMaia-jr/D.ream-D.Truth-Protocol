LitePaper: Discord Workflow for Off-Chain Governance

D.ream D.Truth Protocol

Version 1.0 | June 2025

‚∏ª

Abstract

The D.ream D.Truth Protocol leverages a unique off‚Äëchain governance system on Discord to establish a transparent, merit-based decision-making process. This LitePaper details the Discord workflow for proposal submission, voting, and moderation using non-transferable Soulbound NFTs as credentials. Our system uses specific emojis to capture nuanced community feedback‚Äîallowing proposals to be accepted (and subsequently graded with medals), enhanced for improvement, or rejected and flagged for moderation. This paper explains our daily governance cycle, the role of each voting emoji, and the moderation process, paving the way for our future on‚Äëchain integration.

1. Introduction

In our effort to build a robust decentralized governance ecosystem, the D.ream D.Truth Protocol begins its implementation off‚Äëchain on Discord. Here, only members holding a Truth ID NFT (which also grants them moderator privileges) may initiate proposals, vote, and invite new members. This controlled, member-to-member recruitment ensures that every participant is aligned with our core ethical principles. The Discord workflow is structured around a daily cycle inspired by Dragon Dreaming, ensuring that proposals are thoroughly evaluated, refined, and, if needed, escalated to moderation.

2. Off‚ÄëChain Governance Workflow on Discord

2.1 Membership and Roles
	‚Ä¢	Truth ID NFT Holders:
All members with a Truth ID NFT have full governance rights on Discord, including:
	‚Ä¢	Initiating proposals.
	‚Ä¢	Voting on proposals.
	‚Ä¢	Moderating content and enforcing community rules.
	‚Ä¢	New Members:
Only individuals with a verified Truth ID NFT may participate in governance channels and contribute to proposals, ensuring quality and alignment with our protocol‚Äôs values.

3. Daily Governance Cycle: The Dragon Dreaming Approach

Our governance process follows a daily cycle divided into four phases, synchronized by a clock mechanism:
	1.	Dream Phase (00:00‚Äì03:00 UTC):
	‚Ä¢	Proposal Submission: Members with a Truth ID NFT submit new proposals or ideas.
	‚Ä¢	Focus: Visionary ideation and alignment with collective aspirations.
	2.	Plan Phase (03:00‚Äì07:30 UTC):
	‚Ä¢	Discussion & Refinement: Proposals are discussed, and feedback is provided.
	‚Ä¢	Negotiation: If a proposal triggers the co‚Äëcreation process, negotiation for redistribution of voting power (via Creator NFT splitting) occurs.
	3.	Realize Phase (07:30‚Äì18:00 UTC):
	‚Ä¢	Task Execution & Validation: Members work on proposals, and progress is verified.
	‚Ä¢	Voting for Refinement: Proposals that require further improvements are flagged.
	4.	Celebrate Phase (18:00‚Äì22:00 UTC):
	‚Ä¢	Feedback & Rewards: Completed proposals are reviewed, and high-quality contributions are acknowledged with award medals (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond for co‚Äëcreation).
	‚Ä¢	Minting and Final Tally: Final vote weights are computed in the last 2 hours, incorporating multipliers such as the Truth Red Pill NFT (which acts as a weekly multiplier).

4. Emoji Voting and Moderation Process

4.1 Emoji Voting System

In our Discord-based workflow, members use specific emoji reactions to express their votes on proposals:
	‚Ä¢	Accept Vote (Green Check, ‚úÖ):
	‚Ä¢	Action: If a proposal receives a Green Check, it is approved to advance to the next phase.
	‚Ä¢	Medal Vote Window: Once accepted, a separate window opens where members assign quality medals to the proposal:
	‚Ä¢	Bronze Medal: Basic acceptance.
	‚Ä¢	Silver Medal: Moderate endorsement.
	‚Ä¢	Gold Medal: High-quality contribution.
	‚Ä¢	Diamond (üíé): Triggers co‚Äëcreation negotiation (redistribution of the Truth Creator NFT weight).
	‚Ä¢	Enhance Vote (Gray X, ‚ùé):
	‚Ä¢	Action: Indicates that the proposal requires improvements.
	‚Ä¢	Outcome: The proposer is encouraged to refine and resubmit the proposal.
	‚Ä¢	Reject Vote (Red X, ‚ùå):
	‚Ä¢	Action: A rejection vote initiates a Moderation Flags Window.
	‚Ä¢	Process: When consensus reaches a threshold (via multiple Red X reactions), the proposal (and/or the proposer) is moved to a dedicated Moderation Channel for review.

4.2 Moderation Process

Every Truth ID NFT holder also functions as a moderator. When proposals or interactions fall out of line with our protocol rules, community members can signal this using a tiered flag system:
	‚Ä¢	Yellow Flag (üü®):
	‚Ä¢	First Warning: A single rule violation triggers a 12‚Äëhour stand‚Äëby period.
	‚Ä¢	Orange Flag (üüß):
	‚Ä¢	Second Warning: Multiple violations result in a 24‚Äëhour stand‚Äëby period.
	‚Ä¢	Red Flag (üü•):
	‚Ä¢	Third Warning: Repeated violations lead to a 7‚Äëday stand‚Äëby period.
	‚Ä¢	Black Flag (‚¨õ):
	‚Ä¢	Final Warning: If a wallet is flagged a third time, a 28‚Äëday stand‚Äëby is imposed and the Truth ID NFT is burned, requiring the user to requalify through our educational module.

All flagged actions are consolidated in a dedicated Moderation Channel, ensuring organized reviews and community-based resolution.

5. Transition to On‚ÄëChain Governance

While our current governance model is implemented off‚Äëchain via Discord, our long-term vision is to transition to a fully integrated DApp on the Cosmos network. This migration will:
	‚Ä¢	Record All Actions On‚ÄëChain: Enhancing transparency and security.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain Non-Transferability: Ensuring that Soulbound NFTs remain permanently linked to the original owner.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate a Unified Dashboard: Providing real-time monitoring of proposals, votes, and rewards.

6. Conclusion

The off‚Äëchain governance workflow on Discord establishes a dynamic, time‚Äëbased, and ethically grounded decision-making process for the D.ream D.Truth Protocol. Through our detailed emoji voting system, structured daily cycle, and robust moderation process, we ensure that credibility and governance weight are directly linked to verified, quality contributions. This model sets the stage for a future migration to an on‚Äëchain Cosmos DApp, where all interactions will be recorded with full transparency.
